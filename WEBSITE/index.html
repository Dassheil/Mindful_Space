         The serene environment, cool climate, and lush greenery provide a relaxing atmosphere that reduces stress and
        enhances mental clarity by lowering cortisol levels.
        <p></p> 2. Mt. Kitanglad Range Natural Park: 
        Trekking or enjoying the pristine beauty of this UNESCO park encourages physical activity 
        and fosters a sense of accomplishment, helping to combat depression and boost mental health.
        <p></p> 3. Lake Apo (Valencia City):
        This crater lake, surrounded by lush vegetation, offers a serene setting where activities like 
        boating, picnicking, or admiring the calm waters help reduce stress and soothe the mind.
        <p></p>4. Impasugong Communal Ranch (Impasugong):
        Known as the home of Bukidnon's cowboy culture, its wide-open fields, rolling hills, and grazing animals create

<p></p>This are the coping mechanisms that people often find helpful during difficult times like depressive episodes.
 <p></p>Here are some strategies that many find useful:

 <p></p>☑ Breathe & Be Present:Practice deep breathing or mindfulness to ease anxiety and refocus.  
 <p></p>☑ Seek Support: Talk to someone you trust—connection can reduce isolation.  
 <p></p>☑ Simplify Tasks: Break activities into small, manageable steps.  
 <p></p>☑ Move Your Body: Light exercise or a walk can boost your mood.  
 <p></p>☑ Be Kind to Yourself: It's okay to not be okay—show yourself compassion.  
 <p></p>☑ Engage in Calming Activities: Listen to music, journal, or do something soothing.  
 <p></p>☑ Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge progress, no matter how small.  
 <p></p>☑ Consider Professional Help: Reach out to a therapist for tailored support.  


<p><strong>Information and Resources</strong></p>
    <p></p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 280 million people worldwide
    have depression, which is approximately 3.8% of the global population.

<p></p>This includes:
    <p></p>5% of adults
    <p></p>5.7% of adults over 60 years old
    <p>Depression Statistics Everyone Should Knows:

    <p></p>Depression is more common in women than men, affecting about 50% more women than men.
    However, the actual number of people with depression may be higher because many people don't seek
    professional help.

    <p>The WHO estimates that more than 75% of people in low-income or middle-income countries
    don't receive treatment for depression.Depression can affect people of all ages and from all walks of life, but some factors
    can increase the risk of developing it, including:
    <p>◯ Poverty
    <p>◯ Unemployment
    <p>◯ Death of a loved one or a relationship break-up
    <p>◯ Physical illness
    <p>◯ Problems caused by alcohol and drug use

    <p></p>Given the alarming statistics and the fact that many individuals, particularly in low-income countries, 
    don't receive the support they need, it's clear that mental health awareness and accessibility are more 
    important than ever. The creation of Mindful Minds is our response to this urgent need.
    By providing a safe, supportive space, we aim to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and offer resources to those affected
    by depression and mental health challenges. Our mission is to ensure that no one feels alone in their struggles, 
    empowering individuals to seek help, connect, and heal. We are here to remind everyone that mental wellness is a journey,
    and it's okay to take that journey one step at a time.
